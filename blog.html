                <h1 class="headings">How Long <br> It Took</h1>
                <p>Since I'm new to HTML and CSS it took me about 7-10 days to get used to the different types of elements in css and html. Designing and furnishing took about 3-4 days while the coding took me 7 days to complete. Overall it was a journey of 10 days which I have now accomplished.</p>

                <h1 class="headings">Difficulty</h1>
                <p>This project seemed impossible at first but when I started it, it felt accomplishable. It was a good assignment as we were made to use all the tools we learn in theory classes and made us confident in HTML and CSS. For me it was a pretty hard job to put all the things together to form a Portfolio webpage.</p>

                <h1 class="headings">How I <br> Made This</h1>
                <p>For the completion of this portfolio I tried using all the knowledge gained in class and in books. For some parts I had to check Google and YouTube how the elements could be used and finally I put all the things together to make this portfolio. Images being used in this portfolio have been referenced in the CSS file using comments. Overall it was a good project and helped me learn loads of concepts of HTML and CSS. </p>
